I am a Research Fellow based in the [Manchester Centre for Health Economics](https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/health-economics/) and the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). I have previously been affiliated with the [Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Sciences](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/infection-veterinary-and-ecological-sciences/) at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) as well as the [The Zeeman Institute for Systems Biology & Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/zeeman_institute/) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).

As a **mathematical epidemiologist**, I use a combination of maths, statistics, and computing to answer questions relating to the spread of infectious diseases. The spread of infection is driven both by biological processes at the level of viruses and bacteria and social/ecological processes at the level of human and non-human hosts, and so mathematical epidemiology requires an **interdisciplinary** approach to science. My research has two main goals: to develop **mathematical methods** which can be used by professionals in both academia and public health policy, and to better understand the real-world behaviour of infectious diseases with a view to mitigating their impact through scientifically-informed policy choices. I am particularly interested in the role of **population structure** in the spread of infection, ranging from human demography and family structure to species distribution patterns of wild animals. You can find further details on my research to date on the [Research](https://jbhilton.github.io/research/) tab of this site.
