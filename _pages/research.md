My research sits at the interface between **mathematical epidemiology** and **health economics**, using mathematics, statistics, and computation to understand
different aspects of public health. I have particular expertise in stochastic processes, models of respiratory infections, Bayesian inference, and machine learning. Key areas of my work to date are listed below:

**Household-structured** epidemic models. I am particularly interested in developing new simulation and inference techniques for high-dimensional risk-stratified household models.

Economic assessment of **cancer screening** programs, including risk-stratified breast screening and new cervical cancer screening technologies.

Economic assessment of **personalised medicine** programs.

Models of **health behaviour** including vaccine uptake and responses to public health campaigns.

Eco-epidemiological modelling of **avian influenza** in wild birds using Bayesian machine learning.

**COVID-19 policy modelling**, focusing on the use of age- and household-structured models to understand the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We were particularly interested here in answering questions relating to exemptions to and relaxations of lockdown measures: how effective is a lockdown likely to be if we allow for support bubbles? How disruptive is a temporary relaxation of lockdown rules for an event such as Christmas likely to be?

Analysis of **new and emerging infections** such as Ebola and MPox, and particularly the role of individual-level variability in person-to-person spread.

The role of **demography in endemic childhood infections** such as measles and mumps.
