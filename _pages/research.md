My current and former research interests include the following areas of mathematical epidemiology:

**COVID-19 policy modelling**, focusing on the use of age- and household-structured models to understand the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions.

**Branching process models** of outbreaks of novel and emerging pathogens such as Ebola and MPox.

**Household-structured models** of endemic childhood infections such as measles and mumps.
