# SPI-M-O

During the COVID-19 crisis I contributed to the
 [Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M-O)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/scientific-advisory-group-for-emergencies-sage-coronavirus-covid-19-response-membership/list-of-participants-of-sage-and-related-sub-groups#scientific-pandemic-influenza-group-on-modelling-spi-m-o),
 a subcomittee of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).
 During 2020 and 2021 I carried out modelling studies on several candidates for **non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)** against COVID-19,
 which formed part of the scientific evidence base which was used to guide policy decisions during the pandemic.
 I was specifically involved in policy analyses covering support bubble exemptions to lockdown measures,
 temporary relaxation of lockdown over Christmas 2020,
 and the potential for out-of-household isolation of people with COVID-19 living with clinically extremeley vulnerable individuals.
 The details of the model I used for these contributions are covered in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010390).

Aside from SPI-M-O, I was also involved in advisory modelling for the Department of Health and Social Care assessing COVID-19 vaccination policies for staff in care homes.

For my contributions to SPI-M-O I was awarded the SPI-M-O Award for Modelling and Data Support.
 The members of SPI-M-O were also collectively awarded the
 [2022 Weldon Memorial Prize](https://www.ox.ac.uk/event/modelling-covid-19-pandemic-uk-weldon-memorial-prize-lecture-2022)
 for “noteworthy contributions to the development of mathematical or statistical methods applied to problems in Biology”.
 
# Media
 
 I was quoted in a May 2020 [Times article](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-why-some-countries-seem-to-have-escaped-its-grip-xdr7js8z6)
  (paywalled) on global patterns of COVID-19 spread.
  
# Awards and prizes

  Awarded by the university of Warwick in recognition of [my early work on COVID-19](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008031).
  * **2020** IBM Science for Social Good grant. Grant of £20,000 awarded by IBM to support my research on models of non-pharmeceutical interventions against COVID-19.
  * **2018** IMA Small Grant Scheme, awarded by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications to fund my attendance at the 10th Swedish Meeting on Mathematics in Biology.
